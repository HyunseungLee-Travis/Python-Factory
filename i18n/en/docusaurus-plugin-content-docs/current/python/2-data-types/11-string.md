# Character and String

Character refers to a sign humans use to represent letters, numbers, and other symbols.

`A`, `B`, `1` are all characters.

In Python, if you surround whatever symbol with `''` or `""`, it is a string.

## Saving string data

All strings have to be inside of quotes.

`1` is not a string because it is not surrounded by quotes.

Note that strings inside the quotation marks should be in one-line.

The example below shows us an error when the strings are on a seperate line.

The variable `a` is correctly formatted and saved while the variable `b` is not.

## Multi Line String

To use multi-line syntax, there are multiple ways to achieve this.

1. Simply use multiple `print()` statement
2. Use the escape character `\n` [(Escape Character)](../escapechar/#n) to create a new line.
3. Use triple quotes

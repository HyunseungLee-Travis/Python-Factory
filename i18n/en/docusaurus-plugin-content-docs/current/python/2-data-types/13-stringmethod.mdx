# String Method

## What is a method?

A method is a function that is associated with a class.

This might not make sense, but basically it is a feature we can use to do something with a data type.

For example, we can use the `.split` method to split a string into pieces.

Here, the `.split` is a method to split a string data

## Lowercase and Uppercase methods

It is very important to know about these methods.

In English and a few other languages, the lowercase and uppercase is a very important difference.

To make sure we can handle these differences, we need to turn one into the other.

Usually, uppercase is turned to a lower case with the `lower()` method.

```py
print("HELLO".lower())
```

These kinds of method is usually used to handle inputs.

| Other uper/lower methods | Explanation                                                           |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| title()                  | To a title-format (Make every character in front of a word uppercase) |
| upper()                  | Transform into an uppercase                                           |
| isupper()                | Check if the string is uppercase                                      |
| islower()                | Check if the string is lowercase                                      |

## `len()`

The `len()` method is used for checking how long a string is.

```py
print(len("Hello"))
```

`len` is the shortened word for 'length'.

## `index()`

The `index()` method will help you find where a 'substring' is located.

Substring is a part of a string, and the index is the position of the substring.

```py
print('abcdef'.index('abc')) # prints 0
```

If there is no substring, it will throw an error.

## Operators

Operators are used to perform mathematical operations.

In strings, they are used like a method shortcut.

### `in`

This operator returns a Boolean of whether a substring exists in a string.

```py
print('abc' in 'abcdef') # prints True
```

### `+`

This operator is used to concatenate two strings.

```py
print('abc' + 'def') # prints abcdef
```

Concatenate means to combine together.

### `*`

This operator is used to repeat a string.

```py
print('abc' * 3) # prints abcabcabc
```

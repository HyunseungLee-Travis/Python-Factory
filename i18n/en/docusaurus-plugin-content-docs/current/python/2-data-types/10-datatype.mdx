# Data Type

Different numbers, alphebets, lists are called 'Data Types'.

For example, putting anything inside `""` is a string.

```py
weather = "sunny"
```

## Finding out the data type

Using `type()` function, we can find out the data type of the variable.

```py
print(type("Hello, World"))
```

`<class 'str'>`is the result of running the code above.

It means `"Hello World"` is a string class, which basically means it is a string type.

## Checking the data type

`isinstance()` is a function that checkes if the variable is a sepcfici type.

Put the variable inside the parentheses, and the type of the variable inside the parentheses (2nd

The result will be either `True` or `False`

Because `"sunny"` is a string, `isinstance("sunny", str)` will return `True`.

:::note
In Python, string means letters and we use `str`.
